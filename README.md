This is a simple Python script that grabs the most current METAR weather report from any airport in the US. It uses the tabulate library to display data in an organized way, it includes imperial and metric measurements for everything.

Eventually this code will be implemented into a web app, once I have the time to learn Flask or Django. You can simply put this code into any code editor (it was compiled in VS Code) and run the script.

Feel free to add on to this on your own, it's very basic and has room to add some cool features

Have fun!
